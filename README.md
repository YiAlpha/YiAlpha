### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I combine storytelling passion and analytical savvy to business and life.

Currently, working at [Wolfram Research](https://www.wolfram.com/) for strategic initiatives, my daily job is to plant innovative seeds in marketing, branding, and product release using data analytics and strategic reasoning.

Graduated from Columbia University, I conducted [political sciences research](https://github.com/YiAlpha/sharing-deck/blob/main/Columbia%20Thesis%20Presentation.pdf) with [machine learning](https://github.com/YiAlpha/machine-learning-python), [graph theory](https://github.com/YiAlpha/network-analysis-twitter), and [statistical inference](https://github.com/YiAlpha/randomization-simulation-textbook).
