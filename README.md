ðŸ¤—  **I apply my storytelling passion and analytical savvy to research, business, and life.**

Graduated from Columbia University, my researches focus on using [Randomized Controlled Trails](https://github.com/YiAlpha/randomization-simulation-textbook) (RCTs, people call it A/B testing in the industry) to [encourage voter turnouts](https://github.com/YiAlpha/meta-learner) and [reduce violence against women](https://github.com/YiAlpha/media-experiment). Meanwhile, I have been pursuing Computational Social Sciences' vision by injecting [machine learning](https://github.com/YiAlpha/machine-learning-python), [automation](https://yialpha.github.io/auto-law-review), and [natural language processing](https://github.com/YiAlpha/nlp-python) into traditional social sciences topics.

Early 2020, I decided to join [Wolfram Research](https://www.wolfram.com/) since the company and its founder have been pushing Computational Sciences's vision by developing [tools](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/) and advocating [computational thinking](https://www.computationinitiative.org/).

The subjects in Computational Sciences I care about most is Social Sciences. Therefore, I served as vice president at [Society for Quantitative Approaches to Social Research](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/qasr/) from 2019 to 2020 and hosted workshops for data storytelling on [data wrangling](https://yialpha.github.io/data-wrangling-r), [web scrape](https://yialpha.github.io/web-scrape-workshop/), and [visualizations](https://yialpha.github.io/data-visualization-r) during my tenure. Besides, I have been a consultant for a [Data Journalism Program at Columbia](http://ledeprogram.com/), helping journalists with statistical inferences, computation techniques, and storytelling with data.

Besides computational social sciences, I'm also an open-source enthusiast. As a member of [DataWhale](https://github.com/datawhalechina), a Chinese open-source community, I give [briefings and deep dives](https://yialpha.github.io/sharing-deck/) about tech business, methodologies, and personal management.
